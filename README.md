# Corpora Keylogger

### This project is a keylogger that reports to your Telegram bot. I've tried to polish it as much as possible. I've been working on it for months, and now the most polished version is the one I'll publish.
#
### If you have ever used a keylogger, you know that the text reports all keystrokes in a raw format like `[CAPSLOCK]`, `[SPACE]`, `[BACKSPACE]`. This is a problem that will no longer occur with this keylogger.
