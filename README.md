# Corpora Keylogger

### This project is a keylogger that reports to your Telegram bot. I've tried to polish it as much as possible. I've been working on it for months, and now the most polished version is the one I'll publish.
#
If you have ever used a keylogger, you know that the text reports all keystrokes in a raw format like `[CAPSLOCK]`, `[SPACE]`, `[BACKSPACE]`. This is a problem that will no longer occur with this keylogger.

#

## First version: 
This is the first keylogger version that shows raw info.

#

## Actual Version:
This is the version that doesn't show a raw format and embellishes it so that all the information is clear.

 ### Next, I will explain all the steps to carry it out and be able to use it correctly.
